# catch-falling-objects
'Catch a Technology' is a game to catch falling objects, made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This was one of the first challenges during my internship at Levi9. Big thanks to Levi9 and their amazing team for teaching me a lot of interesting things and for giving me an opportunity to learn at grow at their company.

Some of the things that this game incorporates are closures, destructuring, revealing module pattern, DOM manipulation, JS animation, and so on.
